# Seattle Code Camp

Thanks for visiting the repository for the Seattle Code Camp session entitled "Build a professional looking mobile app in an hour."

This project set out to show how a simple app with some complex functionality (such as capturing an image) could be built using web technologies such as HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The specific technologies used in this project are:

- HTML
- CSS
- Ionic Framework v4 (beta)
- Typescript
- Google's Firebase platform
- the Angular Firebase package
- the Angular CropperJS package

View the presentation PDF for step-by-step instructions on creating this project. Alteratively, just download all the content, create your own Firebase account and replace the credentials stored in the file ```app.module.ts```.

Note: After the session ends the Firebase project referenced in the source code will be 
deleted.
